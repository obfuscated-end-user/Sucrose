Discord music bot.  

### Supports:

* SoundCloud (track links only)
* Spotify (track links only)
* YouTube (videos and playlists)
* YouTube Music (tracks, albums and playlists)
### Does not support:
* Apple Music

Besides playing music, the bot can do a few other things like sharing random Wikipedia articles, posting random YouTube links, and saying "hi." Thatâ€™s about it, really. My main focus is on the music features, but hey, who cares.

I developed this bot as a personal programming project, and yeah, it's still got some bugs here and there.  

For now, it's intended to run exclusively on my friend's server and my own private server, where I personally test and debug commands to avoid flooding my friend's server with stupid crap.
